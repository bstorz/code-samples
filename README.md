# Code Samples
This is a compilation of projects and individual code snippets to show my work in a few different programming languages.  Below is a little blurb on each piece.

#### Custom Shell
Custom shell (jshell3) is a project I completed at the University of Tennessee.  It is a fully functioning (albeit underpowered) CLI shell written in C.  The compiled executable is also included.
#### Custom Tar
Custom tar (jtar) is another project completed at UT also written in C.  It creates and extracts rudimentary tarballs.  The compiled executable is also included.
#### Java Chatroom
Java chatroom (jtalk) is a fully functional CLI chatroom server and client that operates over sockets.  The .jar files are compiled versions of the source.
Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
#### Modal Box
Modal box is a small jquery-based Modal Box that is (very) rudimentary.  It is for use in incredibly sparse and simple website, where multiple features simply aren't needed.
#### Sample API
Sample API is a piece of a larger application that I unfortunately cannot include in whole here.  Sample API is a RESTful PHP API for communicating with a local Python script and a local C program through pipes, accepting input from POST requests and returning the output in JSON.
#### Temperature Monitor
Temperature Monitor was a quick hobby project designed to work with an Arduino to record the room's temperature, store it in a file for debugging, store it in a SQL database, and plot that data on a web-accessible graph.  Python reads from the device over serial USB and parses and stores the data, while PHP reads the data and outputs it on the page.  Lastly, jQuery reads it over AJAX and raphael.js makes it into a pretty graph.  Its an awesome project, but it is not one of my cleaner
pieces of code.
### UT Knoxville Elevators
UT Knoxville Elevators was a piece of software intended for production, but unfortunately it got held up at the last minute by copyright issues.  It includes two pieces, a webapp and an iOS application, and also has several pieces of custom images.  It was designed to be a utility by which a student could report elevators on UT Knoxville campus as being in order or not.
#### Website
My personal website.  It is HTML5 compliant and a decent use of minimalistic design.
